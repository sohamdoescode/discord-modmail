<h4>Pre-defined Snippets</h4>
These snippets come in handy while handling ModMails. When executed (with <code>!<snippet name</code></code>), the corresponding response is triggered and sent to the thread author.
<br>
<b> Snippets and their replies : </b>
<br>
<code>hi</code>: "Hi there! Thank you for contacting our staff team. How may we help you today?"
<br>
<code>transferred</code>: "We have notified the respective department regarding this thread. They will be getting back to you as soon as they can"
<br>
<code>reported</code>: "Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We have started an investigation and needed action will be taken soon"
<br>
<code>morehelp</code>: "Is there anything else we can help you with today?"
<br>
<code>noreply</code>: "This is a gentle reminder that this thread will be closed if you do not reply to it within the next 24 hours"
<br>
<br>
<b> Example Usage </b>
<code> !hi </code> will make the bot reply "Hi there! Thank you for contacting our staff team. How may we help you today?" to the thread author.
